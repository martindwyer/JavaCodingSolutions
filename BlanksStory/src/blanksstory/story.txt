So, here I am working on [noun] even though the [large annual 
event] is getting to be really near and the weather so nice.  So, 
because I have to construct this story, it may as well be about my  
[noun] that I have to do while I am here inside, even though I 
would rather be at [location]. 

My homework involves analyzing objects that are [shape].  Of 
course, the Professor told us to use our [body part] along with 
trigonometry, geometry, and algebra to solve the problem. 

When I got this assignment, I was feeling [first feeling]. 
But after a while I began to feel [second feeling] and just wanted 
to get done, and to go outside.  I really think that studying 
[shape]s will be hard to do while using my [body part], but I am 
told that's how they do it in [foreign country]. 

Well after I got over feeling [second feeling], I decided just to 
get the homework done.  It was the most [adjective] day of my 
life.
