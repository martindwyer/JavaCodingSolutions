# MultiThreadingIllustration
 This application written in Java was modified to run concurrent sessions with threads.  One set of threads (ViewThreads) are generated with user views in scenarios > OneView, TwoView, and AdminView.  Another set of threads (PlanThreads) originates in planning > Planner > getPlan().  The threads themselves are orignated from the threads package.  As is evident from the notes, this package was used for educational purposes.  While it is available under public license, students reusing the code should be careful to follow the guidelines of their academic institution.
